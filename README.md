# GPS-BDS-mixed-positioning
Matlab code for GPS and BDS positioning using full and fractional pseudorange measurements
with all the real data in the paper:
"Single point positioning using full and fractional pseudorange measurements from GPS and BDS" https://doi.org/10.1080/00396265.2019.1683327

Put all .m files in one folder. Decompress data.zip to get the observation and nav message files. Use Matlab to run coarsenavBDGPS.m to see position result and corresponding figure.

Algorithm described in the paper is implemented in mixposlsBDSGPS.m.

Have fun!
